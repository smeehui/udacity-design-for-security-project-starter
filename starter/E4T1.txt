# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Restrict incoming SSH connections to the EC2 instances by disallowing access from the public internet.
2. Prevent root account from logging in application server over ssh.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Configure strong password for ssh account.
2. Provide least privilege to EC2 instance by restricting security policy.
3. Use server-side encryption for S3-bucket.
