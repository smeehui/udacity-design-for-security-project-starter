Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
2. EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address.
3. IAM policy, which is administrator full access, is not following the principle of the least privilege.
4. EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Configure EC2 instances with IMDSv2
2. Use a non-default VPC so that your instance is not assigned a public IP address by default.
3. Provide those privileges which are essentially enough for user to use each service.
4. Use Amazon EC2 host management to manage EC2.
