Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The configured Network ACLs allows access from anywhere and any ports of the internet.
This should be avoided since Network ACLs is supposed to be used for controlling and filtering inbound and outbound network traffic, therefore
can minimalize malicious attacks from the internet and keep the private subnets only for internal access.

# Poor practice 2
The s3 bucket is not configured to be server-side encryption, therefore its objects are readable and vulnerable once the
attacker gains the permission to access the bucket.
