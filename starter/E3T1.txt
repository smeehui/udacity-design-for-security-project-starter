# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Notes: I have conducted brute force attack from attack ec2 to the application server, however, AWS Guard Duty did not reflect
any findings on the summary page, although I waited for more than 2 hours. I searched for the problem on Knowledge and found
a large number of students encountered this issue and not sure why. I had attached the images demonstrating my configuration
and attack attempts in the folder submit_issue, please take a look at it.
